			<h2>Park Amenities: Racing</h2>
			<p>Every weekend, we have several races where you can win cash prizes! There are two different types of races: Trucks and ATV/UTVs. Truck races are made up of three classes: Street Class (Everyday drivers), Class2 (1 Ton and Under), and Class 3 (2.5 Ton and over). All classes have an entry fee of $30 (100% cash payback). In order to race, bring your truck to the Race Sign Up Tent located on vendor row before 1pm on race day. There is a driver's meeting at 2:00pm. Please see all the rules and information for truck racing on our <a href="<?php echo site_url(); ?>/rules">rules</a> page. ATV/UTV races have 6 different classes. There is a $20 entry fee and a $180 purse for each class. In order to race, please bring your ATV/UTV to the sign up tent by 1:30. See all rules and information for ATV/UTV racing on our <a href="<?php echo site_url(); ?>/rules">rules</a> page.</p>

			<h2>Park Amenities: Camping</h2>
			<p>All camping at the Boondocks is primitive and included with your entry fee. There are xx acres dedicated to our camping areas so there is plenty of space to set up your camp. Campfires are permitted (unless there is a burn ban)!</p>

			<h2>Park Amenities: Trails</h2>
			<p>We have over 70 miles of trails for your ATVs. Explore the nature of the park while riding around. All trails close at midnight so there is time for nighttime riding. Please remember all ATVs must have a flag 6ft tall. We do have them available at the gate.</p>

			<h2>Park Amenities: Mudding</h2>
			<p>We have several mud pits at the park. The truck mud pit allows for trucks to go wild without ATVs. ATVs also have their own mud pit. All mud pits open at sunrise and close at sunset. The largest pit is 200 square yards.</p>
